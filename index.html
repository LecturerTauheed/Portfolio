      <h2 style="padding:10px;">About Me</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify; padding:20px;">I am a passionate and dedicated <strong>Lecturer in Computer Science</strong> currently serving in the 
      <strong>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Higher Education Department</strong> since 2024. I am committed to shaping the future of technology by teaching and mentoring undergraduate students in computer science subjects such as programming, web development, and software engineering.
      <br>
      Before joining the Higher Education Department, I served as a <strong>Certified Information Technology Teacher (CT-IT)</strong> in the <strong>Elementary and Secondary Education Department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</strong>. During this tenure, I played a key role in introducing and strengthening IT skills at the school level, helping students build a strong foundation in digital literacy and technology.
     <br>
    
      With a deep understanding of both academic and practical aspects of computer science, I bring a unique blend of teaching, technical expertise, and real-world problem-solving. I am also skilled in curriculum design, academic advising, and integrating innovative teaching methods using technology.
